    "1. The authors presented the figure-1 to present the construction of the support system, that is how the shaft is put in the rolling element bearing, which is put on the squeeze film damper to connect with the bearing housing. I agree that this is an introductory figure to explain the support system. However, I expect a better diagram to understand the system better. "

    "2. The diagram should contain a front view of all the stages of the representative gears as well as the support system. The question is that is whether the shaft system is supported on one end or on both ends? The diagram should depict the coordinate system with respect to which the equations of motion will be written. The authors have shown the velocity components U1 and V1, of the journal surface but have not shown U2 and V2, of the bearing housing on figure 1(b). These should be shown. "

The equations of motion are derived in terms of generalized coordinates. So, the process of deriving the equations of motion is unclear.\n"

It is well known that bifurcations and chaos, which are the effects of nonlinearities and of time variation on the dynamic behaviour of a system get effectively smoothened by applying stationary dissipation effects. Therefore, the question is about the novelty of the work. The work is not novel.\n"
